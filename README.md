# Goal
Work in progress. The goal of this project is to create a top down 2D shooter using C++ that emphasizes the use of power-ups to create fast paced challenges that require the player to quickly form a plan of attack. 
Players will move from room to room defeating wizards using different types of spells to defeat different types of enemies. Clearing all rooms will result in a mission complete.
